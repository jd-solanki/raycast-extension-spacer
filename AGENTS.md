- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- ALWAYS read the docs and don't assume anything

## Feature Development/Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the question extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of the concision.
- Always use Context7 MCP for library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps
- Make sure we've gone down all the branches of the design tree we can anticipate

## Coding Guidelines

- Readable & Modular code
- Follow DRY & KISS principle
- Add comments for What & Why. Avoid comments which I can infer from code (How)
